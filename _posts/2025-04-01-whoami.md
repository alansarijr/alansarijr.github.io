title: Who Am I ?
---

I'm Mohamed El Ansary aka nemo, a cybersecurity enthusiast and reverse engineering addict. I thrive on breaking binaries, dissecting firmware, and uncovering hidden vulnerabilities. Whether it's hardware hacking, penetration testing, or firmware security, I’m always chasing the next exploit. The game is simple—break, analyze, and secure. And I play to win.
